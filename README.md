# Swiss Vehicle Registration Analytics

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Automated analytics dashboard for Swiss new vehicle registrations, built from [ASTRA/IVZ Open Data](https://opendata.astra.admin.ch/ivzod/1000-Fahrzeuge_IVZ/1200-Neuzulassungen/).

A GitHub Actions pipeline downloads raw registration data monthly, aggregates it, generates charts, and produces a delta report with MoM, YoY, and YTD comparisons.

## Definitions

- **Scope:** `Fahrzeugart = Personenwagen` only (passenger cars). Excludes vans (Lieferwagen), trucks (Lastwagen), motorcycles (Motorrad), buses, tractors, and all other vehicle types.
- **EV:** BEV + PHEV + FCEV (Treibstoff: Elektrisch, Benzin/Elektrisch, Wasserstoff/Elektrisch, Elektrisch mit RE)
- **BEV:** Fully electric only (Treibstoff: Elektrisch, Elektrisch mit RE)

## Dashboard

### New Registrations Trend

Total passenger car (Personenwagen) registrations per year since 2016. The COVID-19 impact in 2020 is clearly visible, with the market not yet recovering to pre-pandemic levels.

### Powertrain Transition

How Switzerland's new car market is shifting from combustion to electric. Petrol and diesel are shrinking while BEV and PHEV grow year over year.

### Brand Rankings Over Time

Position changes of the top 10 brands. Watch for brands climbing or falling through the ranks across a decade of data.

## EV Analytics

### The EV Wave

BEV + PHEV share of new passenger car registrations by canton, animated from Jan 2016 to Feb 2026. Shows the electrification wave spreading across Switzerland.

### The BEV Race

Top 10 fully electric (BEV only) brands by trailing 12-month registrations. Watch Tesla's explosive rise and the competitive response.

### Geography of EV Taste

Location Quotient for top 6 BEV brands — where each brand over/underperforms vs the national average. LQ > 1.0 means overrepresented in that canton.

## How It Works

```
download.py -> process.py -> chart.py -> report.py
```

1. **Download** -- fetches NEUZU.txt (current year) and archive files (2016-2025) from ASTRA
2. **Process** -- parses TSV files with dtype optimization, applies `mappings.yaml` classifications, outputs aggregated CSVs
3. **Chart** -- generates charts with professional styling and dynamic attribution
4. **Report** -- produces a monthly delta report (MoM + YoY + YTD) in markdown

Runs automatically on the 5th of each month via GitHub Actions. Can also be triggered manually.

## Classification

All classifications are driven by `mappings.yaml`:
- **Brand origin** -- brand heritage (Fiat = Italy, even though Stellantis is Dutch-registered)
- **Corporate group** -- parent company (Fiat = Stellantis, Audi = Volkswagen Group)
- **Fuel type** -- normalized powertrain categories
- **Colors** -- German to English translation
- **Drive type** -- AWD/FWD/RWD

Unknown values go to an "Other" bucket and are logged to `warnings.log` for review. Edit `mappings.yaml` to reclassify -- no code changes needed.

## Local Development

# Run pipeline
uv run scripts/download.py    # ~1GB total download
uv run scripts/process.py     # ~2-5 min
uv run scripts/chart.py       # ~10 sec
uv run scripts/report.py      # instant
```

**Coverage:** 2016-present (~250k-320k passenger cars per year)
**Scope:** Passenger cars (Personenwagen) only

Raw data files (~100MB each) are not committed to this repo. Only aggregated CSVs and charts are tracked in git.
